        MLP Color Theory!

    <div class="intro">
        <p>
            What is color theory? Color theory is both the science and art of using color. It explains how humans perceive color; and the visual effects of how colors mix, match or contrast with each other. ... In color theory, colors are organized on a color wheel and grouped into 3 categories: primary colors, secondary colors and tertiary colors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The seven major color schemes are monochromatic, analogous, complementary, split complementary, triadic, square, and rectangle (or tetradic).
        </p>
        <p>
            In color theory, a color scheme is the choice of colors used in various artistic and design contexts. For example, the "Achromatic" use of a white background with black text is an example of a basic and commonly default color scheme in web design.

            <p>
                Monochromatic colors are all the colors of a single hue, eriving from a single base hue and extending using shades, tones and tints.

            </h1>
            <p>
                Complementary colors are colors that cancel each other's hue to produce an achormatic light mixture.

            <p>
                Also called compound harmony, is a color scheme of a three-color combination consisting of 1 base color and 2 colors that are 150 degrees and 210 degrees apart from the base color. It has the same sharp visual contrast as the complementary color scheme, but has less pressure.
            </p>

        <div class="analogous">

            <p>
                Also called dominance harmony, these color schemes are groups of colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel, with one being the dominant color (which tends to be a primary or secondary color) and two on either side complementing, which tend to be tertiary.
            </p>

        <div class="triadic">
            <h1>
                Triadic
            </h1>
            <p>
                This color scheme is a three-color combination consisting of one base color and 2 colors that are 120 degrees and 240 degrees apart from the base color; in the shape of a triangle, hence the name Triadic. These color schemes tend to be quite vibrant. Even when using pale or unsaturated versions of hues, it offers a higher degree of contrast while also retaining the color harmony.

        <div class="tetradic">

                Tetradic
            </h1>
            <p>
                Also called double complementary, this color scheme is considered the richest because it uses four colors arranged into two complementary color pairs. The scheme is hard to harmonize and requires a color to dominate or subdue the colors; if all four colors are used in equal amounts, the color scheme may look unbalanced.

        <div class="polychromatic">
            <h1>
                Polychromatic
            </h1>
            <p>
                The term Polychromatic means having several colors. It is used to describe light that exhibits more than one color, which also means that it contains radiation of more than one wavelength. The study of polychromatic is particularly useful in the production of diffraction gratings.

                What is a color palette?
            </h2>
            <p>
                A color palette, also known simply as a palette, refers to the full range of colors that are displayed in the given image. Ie, the canvas or the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm going to be talking about the different color palettes used in the show and the fandom. Specifically, the differences between character colors in the show (G4) and character colors of the fandom that have varied and/or are similar.
